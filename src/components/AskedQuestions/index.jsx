                  To book a car on Turo, you must create a Turo account, be 18 years old or older in the US, 21 years old or older in the UK, 23 years old or older in Canada, have a valid driver’s license, and get approved to drive on Turo. When you’re booking your first trip, you’ll go through a quick approval process by entering your driver’s license and some other information. In most cases, you’ll get approved immediately, and you’ll be set for all future road trips, day trips, and business trips!

                Yes, multiple guests can drive the car you book on Turo, as long as they are all approved to drive. The primary driver (whoever booked the car) can add additional drivers with no fees or additional charges. Only the primary driver can request to add drivers; Turo hosts cannot do it for you. We encourage you to request to add additional drivers before your trip starts, though guests in the US and Canada can request to add a driver while a trip is in progress.

                You can cancel and get a full refund up to 24 hours before your trip starts. If you book a trip with less than 24 hours’ notice, you have one hour after booking to cancel free of charge. If you cancel after the free cancellation period ends, you will be charged a small cancellation fee.

                Under the enhanced cleaning policy, hosts are required to clean and disinfect their vehicles thoroughly before every trip, so you can feel safe and comfortable behind the wheel. Turo hosts have access to training materials on enhanced safety measures and cleaning practices to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 or other viruses.
